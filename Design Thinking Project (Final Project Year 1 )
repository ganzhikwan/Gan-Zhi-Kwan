Reflection
This project has been a valuable experience. One of the most valuable lessons is to go through the whole Design Thinking cycle, from user empathy to a full prototype.

We began with the Empathy phase and learned the importance of being anchored in real pain, not hypotheses, starting from the Empathy phase.
The development of the “Overwhelmed Student Explorer” helped our team have a concrete focus.

It allowed us to define the essence of “Information Fragmentation” from that research so that our solution responded to a real problem.

From Ideation & Prototyping, abstract needs were formed into a tangible vision: the “Smart Travel-Planning Assistant.” 
Through building a prototype, we exercised critical thinking about both user flows and functionalities. This helped fill the gap that separates a good idea from a good product.

Most significantly, it was during the Testing phase that we got the reality check that we needed. 
Getting feedback from the end users reminded us of the fact that what we believe is good is not necessarily what we want, or what they will find intuitive and useful.

In summary, this project showed us the value of innovation and the power of system development. 
The best system development and innovation come from the fundamental need and understanding of the user, and it requires collaboration and the exchange of ideas. 
This teaches us all the value of what we will face in the final year project and the working world.
