Reflection - PC ASSEMBLE 

Participating in the PC assembly class was a meaningful and eye-opening experience for me. 
Before this class, my understanding of computer hardware was mostly theoretical, and I had limited confidence in handling internal components directly.
Through this hands-on session, I was able to physically assemble a computer and better understand how each component works together to form a complete system.


Overall, this PC assembly class enhanced my technical skills, teamwork, and confidence in handling computer hardware.
