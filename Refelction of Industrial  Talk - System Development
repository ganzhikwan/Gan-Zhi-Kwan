Reflection of Industrial  Talk - System Development

The talk prompted important self-reflection for our team. It reinforced that technical skill in coding alone is insufficient. 
As students , we need to strengthen our hard skills and critical soft skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. 
The warning against over-reliance on AI for coding was particularly insightful, reminding us that technology is a tool to augment, not replace, our fundamental understanding.

In conclusion, this session did more than teach us about systems and projects. It connected our present learning to our future selves. 
It emphasized that the concepts we study, like SDLC, are not just exam topics but essential professional languages. 
The speaker’s candid sharing transformed our perspective, motivating us to engage more actively in our education, seek hands-on experience, 
and consciously develop the well-rounded skill set required to thrive in the industry we are preparing to enter.
