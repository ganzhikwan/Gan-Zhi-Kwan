Refelction 
Attending the PPG industrial talk was a worthwhile experience that gave me a clear, practical understanding of how data and information systems power big, international corporations.

Understanding the enormous scope and difficulty of digital transformation was the most important lesson learned. 
Finding out about PPG's "Connect PPG S/4 Transformation" to deploy a worldwide SAP system made it clear that progress for a large organization goes beyond simply implementing new software. 
It's a fundamental change toward becoming "connected, agile, and scalable," which necessitates overcoming disjointed systems and altering human behavior. 
It gave the abstract idea of "enterprise systems" a practical, strategic feel.

Lastly, the session had a significant influence on me personally. It helped us understand that the skills we are learning—in cybersecurity, data management, 
and cloud platforms—are essential and in-demand in today's workforce rather than merely academic subjects. 
We are inspired to expand our knowledge in these crucial areas by witnessing their direct application in a top organization like PPG.

In a nutshell, this talk effectively connected what we learned in the classroom with its practical application in the workplace. 
It gave us a better understanding of how technology fits into business strategy and rekindled our desire to acquire the skills necessary to support such changes in our future careers.
